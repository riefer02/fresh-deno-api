Today I got up drank some coffee and deploy some code before helping move Aastha. We went and picked up Lincoln's truck he let us borrow for the afternoon. He had left it overnight at out other Ross' house.

I moved all the pieces out of the old room while Aastha went ahead to stage the items for loading out.

It took two trips with the truck to get all the big stuff. We will have to go back and get some more tomorrow.

It was a fun and productive day!
