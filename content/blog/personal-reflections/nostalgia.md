  Feeling nostalgic as I look at the map of Candlekeep from Baldur's Gate

I've been having these feelings lately during the middle of the day. Where I just yearn to feel the strength of my imagination as it was in youth. My desire to consume and create games and art from my childhood leaks into my daily routine. Like a flashback I'm immediately brought back to those moments of relaxation, joy, and freedom.

Once the moment passes I return to reality and I want to show gratitude for my mother and father, brothers, friends and family - the list goes on.

Someday I will create a game for others to find that same feeling. I wish my friends knew how much I cared about all of them. They are the building blocks of my reality, but I can never forgot the strength of my imagination and the boon it has on my existence.
