  Took a trip to the family cabin in New Mexcio with Aastha and Dayzee. The cabin was magical.

Aastha and I planned a trip to New Mexico a few months back and it's finally arrived. We drove the nine hour drive over two days. It was exhausting, but as soon as we arrived in the Mountains of Ruidoso it was rejuvenating. We spent the first day drinking, gaming, and watching movies because it was wicked windy outside.

The wind has diminished on the second day and we are looking at taking a little hike, preparing for the winter weather, and more lounging. I still have to work on Monday, but I don't think it will be too bad.
