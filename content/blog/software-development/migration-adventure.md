  I am on a massive quest to upgrade my AWS hosted strapi instance to v4 and my gatsby front end to v5

I am currently working on upgrading both the back and front end for a website I manage. The whole process is helping me grow as a developer which is nice, but geez is it arduous.

After probably 20+ hours I have finally converted my strapi from v3 to v4, which includes the code and the database - but only locally. More challenges await getting it into production.

I have learned a lot about AWS and also the internal machinations of strapi. As much as strapi has put me through hell, I honestly like it a lot!

Before I push up the new strapi v4 instance to production I need to get the front end synchronized with the back. This means updating the gatsby-plugin-strapi to the latest version and also gatsby itself. It's a bit insane and honestly I keep hitting blocker after blocker, but progress is made little by little.

Very excited to have this massive project behind me, but for now I must find joy in the journey. Hopefully I can get a job doing backend management soon!
