  Andrew successfully generated a presigned url for fetching user avatars.

After a very long time trudging through poor documentation I was able to upload an image as a user avatar and render it to the front end successfully. There was a bit of overhead added to the page load, but that is to be expected with images and more asynchronous code execution.

Looking forward to the next challenge, "Streaming Audio" with haste and efficiency. Cheers!
