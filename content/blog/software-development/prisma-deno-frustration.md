Absolutely at my wits end with prisma deno env variable issue. I have been following all the documentation and have scoured forums online and still it will not read my `.env` file. I'm so tired now and frustrated I've been at it for weeks.

I know this is a learning pain, but I'm getting so sick of all the fucking blockers. I will never be able to create enterprise level software if I can't connect these packages.

Please help me.
