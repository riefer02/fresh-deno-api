March has been good in Austin, Texas and I have been enjoying SXSW and tracking more demos for my album.
The weather has been superb and I have enjoyed seeing friends out and about around town.

I was charged with good vibes after a long stint of day shows. There is just something magical about music outside during the day that just can't be described easily.

Relaxing, rejuvenating, and generally reinvigorating.

I took that energy and channeled it into the album for my solo project - which sounds funny to say. Considering,
it's just me and I don't think it's a project :haha:

I really enjoy exploring each of the instruments this time around and trying to find groove and melodic energy to
ignite the mix and entertain.

Hope ya'll had a good SXSW too and talk soon.
