Yesterday, after a lot of thought, I decided it was time to end my band of 5+ years. We started in 2017 I believe - I'll have to fact check that, and we ended September 21st, 2022. My heart had grown very heavy carrying the burden of the Lewd Dudes success. The growns of the team, production slowing, mass marketing pressure, and musical differences killed the vibe, and ultimately the spirit.

Although, I am sad to not play with my friends anymore, it was time to go. I have already been flowing with musical energy, and I am cherishing the feeling.
