  Working with musicians in the studio who have no prior experience can be an test of patience.

Recently, I worked with a band to record their EP. They were not the most experience musicians when it came to their instruments or their history working in a studio. It was a rather long process, but in the end we discovered some great new tone for recording guitar amps and the API 5500.

I am always happy to help be apart of a young musicians journey. I understand that it takes time and not everyone is in the same place in their musician's journey.
