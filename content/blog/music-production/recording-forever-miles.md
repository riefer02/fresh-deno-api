In november we began a journey to track four songs for the Forever Miles LP.

The drums were expertly crafted. The guitar was a thick creamy mids. The bass was a dynamic effect. The vocals were like 
wine flavored cigarettes. The horn was a booming siren.

Really looking forward to hearing the final mix on these pieces.

Had a big struggle moving the project to Logic Pro X. I dealt with technical issues constantly, but at the end of the day we got it and 
it's all apart of the journey.

I wonder if I might push for the guitarist to do an acoustic track for their album. I think it would add a lot of depth to their
sonic persona and showcase his talent. Which frankly the whole group has in spades.

Going to step away for a bit, then come back to it and reflect.
